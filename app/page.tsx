              <li>
                <strong>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):</strong> Processes are
                executed in the order they arrive, with no preemption. Once a
                process starts, it runs to completion. This is the simplest
                scheduling algorithm.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive:</strong> Also known
                as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). The process with the
                shortest remaining execution time is selected next. If a new
                process arrives with a shorter burst time, the current process
                is preempted.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive:</strong> The
                process with the shortest burst time is selected and runs to
                completion before the next process is chosen. Once a process
                starts, it is not preempted until it finishes.

              <li>
                <strong>Priority Scheduling (Preemptive):</strong> Processes are
                assigned a priority, and the CPU is allocated to the process
                with the highest priority. If a new process with a higher
                priority arrives, it preempts the current process.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive):</strong> Similar
                to preemptive priority scheduling, but once a process starts, it
                runs to completion, regardless of any higher-priority processes
                that may arrive.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Round Robin (RR):</strong> Each process is assigned a
                fixed time quantum. The CPU cycles through the processes in a
                circular order, giving each process a turn. If a process doesnâ€™t
                complete within its time quantum, it is placed back in the queue
                to await its next turn.
