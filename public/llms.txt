# CPU Scheduling Visualizer

> A free, interactive educational tool for learning and understanding CPU scheduling algorithms

## About

CPU Scheduling Visualizer is an open-source web application that helps students, educators, and professionals understand how operating system CPU scheduling algorithms work through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that executes processes in arrival order
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that prioritizes shortest burst time
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: Preemptive version of SJF
- **Round Robin**: Time-sharing algorithm with configurable time quantum
- **Priority Scheduling**: Both preemptive and non-preemptive variants
- **Dark Mode / Light Mode**: Full theme toggle with system preference detection
- **Preset Examples**: Curated scenarios including FCFS demo, convoy effect, starvation, and quantum-size impact

## Capabilities

- Interactive Gantt chart generation
- Automatic calculation of waiting time and turnaround time
- Algorithm performance comparison (line chart)
- PDF export of results (input table, output table, Gantt chart, comparison chart)
- Preset example inputs for quick learning (convoy effect, starvation, quantum impact)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode support

## Metrics Calculated

- Completion Time per process
- Turnaround Time (Completion Time − Arrival Time)
- Waiting Time (Turnaround Time − Burst Time)
- Average Turnaround Time
- Average Waiting Time

## Target Audience

- Computer Science students studying Operating Systems
- GATE exam aspirants
- Software engineering interview preparation
- Educators and professors teaching OS courses
- Self-learners exploring computer science fundamentals
- Researchers comparing scheduling algorithm performance
