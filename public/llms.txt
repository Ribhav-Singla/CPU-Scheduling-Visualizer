# CPU Scheduling Visualizer

> A free, interactive educational tool for learning and understanding CPU scheduling algorithms

## About

CPU Scheduling Visualizer is an open-source web application that helps students, educators, and professionals understand how operating system CPU scheduling algorithms work through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that executes processes in arrival order
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that prioritizes shortest burst time
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: Preemptive version of SJF
- **Round Robin**: Time-sharing algorithm with configurable time quantum
- **Priority Scheduling**: Both preemptive and non-preemptive variants

## Capabilities

- Interactive Gantt chart generation
- Automatic calculation of waiting time and turnaround time
- Algorithm performance comparison
- PDF export of results
- Mobile-responsive design

## Target Audience

- Computer Science students
- GATE exam aspirants
- Software engineering interview preparation
- Educators and professors
- Self-learners
